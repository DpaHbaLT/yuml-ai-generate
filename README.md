# yuml-ai-generate

This is an example of using AI to create manifests for Kubernetes. The kubectl-ai tool was used to produce the demo.

|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------|
| Simple application    | I need a Kubernetes manifest to deploy a simple application. Please include the following specifications: Application Name: SimpleApp, Container Image: nginx:latest, Port: 80x. Don't use deployment. I need just a pod. Add labels | Create simple Nginx application | [app.yaml](https://github.com/DpaHbaLT/yuml-ai-generate/blob/main/yaml/app.yaml) |
| Liveness check        | I need a Kubernetes manifest to deploy a simple application. Please include the following specifications: Application Name: SimpleApp, Container Image: nginx:latest, Port: 80x. Don't use deployment. I need just a pod. Add labels. Add liveness with timeout 1 and period 10. | App and Liveness | [app-livenessProbe.yaml](https://github.com/DpaHbaLT/yuml-ai-generate/blob/main/yaml/app-livenessProbe.yaml) |
| Liveness plus readiness | I need a Kubernetes manifest to deploy a simple application. Please include the following specifications: Application Name: SimpleApp, Container Image: nginx:latest, Port: 80x. Don't use deployment. I need just a pod. Add labels. Add liveness with timeout 1 and period 10. Add readiness probe with period 2. | App liveness and readiness | [app-readinessProbe.yaml](https://github.com/DpaHbaLT/yuml-ai-generate/blob/main/yaml/app-readinessProbe.yaml) |
| Liveness plus readiness | I need a Kubernetes manifest to deploy a simple application. Please include the following specifications: Application Name: SimpleApp, Container Image: nginx:latest, Port: 80x. Don't use deployment. I need just a pod. Add labels. Add liveness with timeout 1 and period 10. Add readiness probe with period 2. Add volume mount from host /var/lib/data to /data. | All above plus volume mount | [app-volumeMounts.yaml](https://github.com/DpaHbaLT/yuml-ai-generate/blob/main/yaml/app-volumeMounts.yaml) |
| Cron job              | I need a cron job scheduled for every 5 minutes running command echo Hello world. | Cron job Hello world every 5 min | [app-cronjob.yaml](https://github.com/DpaHbaLT/yuml-ai-generate/blob/main/yaml/app-cronjob.yaml) |
| A job                 | I need a job named app-job-rsync. It should never restart, mount to /data/input, run sh script gsutil -m rsync -dr gs://glow-sportradar/ /data/input, use google/cloud-sdk:275.0.0-alpine with a volume named data-input on the persistent disk glow-data-disk-200. | Kubernetes Job | [app-job.yaml](https://github.com/DpaHbaLT/yuml-ai-generate/blob/main/yaml/app-job.yaml) |
| Multicontainer        | I need a multicontainer app on one pod which consists of 2 containers. First is nginx maintaining the default HTML directory, second will be a bash script written as a command line. The script should write the current date to index.html every second. | Multicontainer job | [app-multicontainer.yaml](https://github.com/DpaHbaLT/yuml-ai-generate/blob/main/yaml/app-multicontainer.yaml) |
| Limit resources       | I need a Kubernetes manifest to deploy a simple application. Please include the following specifications: Application Name: SimpleApp, Container Image: nginx:latest, Port: 80x. Don't use deployment. I need just a pod. Add labels. Add liveness with timeout 1 and period 10. Add readiness probe with period 2. Limit CPU to 100m and memory to 256mi. | Limit resources | [app-resources.yaml](https://github.com/DpaHbaLT/yuml-ai-generate/blob/main/yaml/app-resources.yaml) |
| Env Vars              | I need a Kubernetes manifest to deploy a simple application. Please include the following specifications: Application Name: SimpleApp, Container Image: nginx:latest, Port: 80x. Don't use deployment. I need just a pod. The app should take environment variables SECRET_USERNAME and SECRET_PASSWORD. | Use environment variables | [app-secret-env.yaml](https://github.com/DpaHbaLT/yuml-ai-generate/blob/main/yaml/app-secret-env.yaml) |
